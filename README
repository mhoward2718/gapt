*      GAPT: General Architecture for Proof Theory      *
 *******************************************************

GAPT is a proof theory framework. The framework aims at
creating data types, algorithms, parsers, transformations 
and other components common in proof theory in general 
and automated proof theory in particular.

Requirements:
* Unix-compatible environment
* Java 1.7 or later
* Prover9 (the binaries prover9, prooftrans and 
   tptp_to_ladr must be present in the path [1])
  available at: http://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/mace4/download 
* MiniSAT (the binary minisat mist be present in the path)
  available at: http://minisat.se/MiniSat.html
* Several MaxSAT solvers[3] (optional)

Compilation:
* sbt assembly

Running:
* The scripts cli.sh, gui.sh, atp.sh look for the assembled jar and set Java's
  memory limits to something we found useful over time.

Notes:

[1] Ubuntu Linux' prover9 package does not contain tptp_to_ladr,
    please also install the ladr4-apps package
[2] On some MacOS X installation there might be some additional configuration done,
