define A of type o by (all x ( f x  = 0 | f x = 1 ))
define I of type i->o by (\x => (all n exists k (f n = x) -> (f ((n + k) + 1) = x) )

proof \psi proves   A :- I 0, I 1 ;

with define left by A in
    (all x ( f x  = 0 | f x = 1 )) :-
with define right by I 0 in
     :- (all n exists k (f n = 0) -> (f ((n + k) + 1) = 0) ;
with all right \alpha in
    :- exists k (f \alpha = 0) -> (f ((\alpha + k) + 1) = 0) ;
