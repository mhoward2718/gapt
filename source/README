*        GAPT: General Architecture for Proofs        *
*******************************************************

GAPT is a proof theory framework. The framework aims at
 creating data types, algorithms, parsers, transformations 
and other components common in proof theory in general 
and mechanized proof theory in particular.

Requirements:
* Unix-compatible environment (Linux, MacOsX[2])
* Java 1.6 or later (tested with Oracle's JVM)
* Prover9 (the binaries prover9, prooftrans and 
   tptp_to_ladr must be present in the path [1])
  available at: http://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/mace4/download 

Running:
* The scripts cli.sh and prooftool.sh look for 
  their respective jar files in the path and the current
  directory and set Java's memory limits to something
  we found useful over time

* Alternatively, you can run the jar files directly by calling
  'java -Xss2m -Xmx2g -jar gapt-cli-1.4.jar' 
  and 
  'java -Xss2m -Xmx2g -jar prooftool-1.4.jar'

[1] Ubuntu Linux' prover9 package does not contain tptp_to_ladr,
    please also install the ladr4-apps package
