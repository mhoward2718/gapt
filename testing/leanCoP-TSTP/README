This directory contains all solutions leanCoP finds for the TPTP library (as of
2014). Thanks to Geoff Sutcliffe for providing the tarball leanCoPSolutions.tgz. This
tarball contains the output of leanCoP in TPTP solution format which (for
leanCoP) is essentially just a commented version of the original prover's output.
For testing purposes a directory tree of leanCoP output files is expected. To
generate this, do the following:

$ tar xzf leanCoPSolutions.tgz
$ ./mk_s_to_out

Troubleshooting:
1) the location of awk might not be in /bin/awk. Change location if required.
