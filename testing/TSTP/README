This directory contains TSTP[1] solutions computed by prover9[2] and leanCoP[3]. 
These are essentially the original output proofs in each prover's syntax, except
from the fact that they are commented out (lines start with %). To get the actual
proofs, please run:

./get-proofs <prover>

where prover is either 'leanCoP' or 'prover9'. This creates a directory with the
prover name where all the proofs will be.

Thanks to Geoff Sutcliffe for providing the files.
