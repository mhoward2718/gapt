This directory contains all proofs found by the veriT-solver in the
QF_UF-section of the SMT-LIB (as of October 2012) that contain up to
100 instantiations (counting both goal and theory axioms). Thanks
to Pascal Fontaine for providing these files. To unpack the tarball, do:

$ tar xvfz veriT-SMT-LIB-QF_UF.tar.gz
