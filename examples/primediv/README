This folder contains a formal proof that every number greater than 1 has a prime divisor
from the least number principle. This statement is inferred from two Lemmas:

  The least number principle implies the induction principle, and
  The induction principle implies that every number greater than 1 has a prime divisor.

This proof is formalized in second-order logic.
