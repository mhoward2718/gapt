These are higher order proofs in the LKsk calculus given as LLK format.

To see them start the cli (assuming you are in the gapt/source directory) and call the following commands:

/* loads a simple combinatory proof (the pigeon hole principle for 3 pigeons and 2 holes) and shows the expansion tree */
val pdb = loadLLK("../examples/hol-tape/pigeon32.llk")
prooftool(pdb.proof("PROOF"))

val et = extractExpansionSequent(pdb.proof("PROOF"))
prooftool(et)

/* loads a simple combinatory proof (the pigeon hole principle for 3 pigeons and 2 holes) and shows the expansion tree */
val pdb = loadLLK("../examples/hol-tape/kommfo.llk")
prooftool(pdb.proof("THEPROOF"))

val elp = eliminateDefinitions(pdb, "THEPROOF")
prooftool(elp)
