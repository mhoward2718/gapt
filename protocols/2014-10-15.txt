= Underscores in Prover9 Import  =

Problem: different parts of the system have different requirements on string symbols (e.g. we render _ in Latex notation in prooftool, it was escaped -> problems with reexporting to verit). Clean solution: take export function from tptpExport and generalize. Use existing infrastructure like algorithms.lk.replaceNames and algorithms.resolution.NameReplacement.)

Proposition: implement lifting of formula transformation to proof (i.e. map) on LK proofs and Resolution proofs.

= Regression tests =

We would like to run regression tests on the tptp library. This takes about a day, we will add jenkins code to have a regression_tests directory which can be enabled manually (see project/build/plugins/executions/skip entry in the pom file of the integration tests). The requirement is that the number of passed tests improves and we get notified, when succeeding tests fail, i.e failing tests are allowed in general. We looked at the jenkins regression test plugin, which should do the job, but it probably needs separate test cases per tptp problem.

= QMaxSAT on Compile Server =

We need it installed there. Christoph will send Martin a list of tgz.

= Documentation Day =

We will take 7.11. Menger from 9-18h to document the system better.
