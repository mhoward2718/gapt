= Progress of removing AbsInScope =

We looked at the remaining occurrences of AbsInScope and made the following decisions how to handle them:

* remove freevars_boundvars_constants_of, as it is a refined variant of getFreeAndBoundVariables and is only used in lkmodulo
* remove lkmodulo, as it is not very advanced yet and we decided not to follow this line of thought any further
* remove superfluous imports (especially of AbsInScope)
* in hol2fol comment why we need the AbsInscope matcher, seperate introduction of constants for anonymous functions 
  (fol as subset of typed lambda calculus doesnt need abstraction outside of quantfiers. a hol proof might still
    have abstractions for which a name needs to be introduced, e.g. during skolemization.)
* move checkLambdaTerm from lk to lambda

= getAncestors does not work as expected=

Cvetan experienced scala.Match errors calling getAncestors (an object in calculi/lk) in his code. Interestingly, a copy of the same object in his code did not throw the error.
Performing mvn clean and rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/at before a recompile solved the issue.
