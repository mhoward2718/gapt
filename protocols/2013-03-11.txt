= Discussion of last meeteing's Topics =

During the last meeting, we decided to wait for Daniel's input on some topics:

* Git/GitHub: 

The general opinion seems to be that git is very convenient, but not necessary for the project. We therefore decided to stick with subversion for the time being. 
To help with integration of patches we can have a look how git creates patches against specific versions. Then we can integrate them without forcing external users to use svn.

* CERES for FOL:

Cvetan started with implmenting of a function to assemble the acnf from the projections and a resolution refutation. Daniel pointed out that actually in the schema code the acnf is constructed in the first-order manner. A short investigation of the code[1] didn't give any dependencies on schema code, so we should be able to reuse this function. 

This should be in the CLI and user's guide.

* DeBruijn Indices:

We had some discussion about a sensible use of using AbsInScope to access the otherwise hidden deBruijn index information in variables.
A concensus seems to be that the indices should be transparent to the user. Therefore ee decided to restrict the use of functions which expose the de Bruijn index to the lambda calculus module.

We did not decide which variant lamda calculus we want to implement(with/without indices, Tomer's variant or the original deBruijn ones, etc.). 
In order to prevent the exposure we are removing AbsInScope from all algorithms outside lambda calculus, then only getFreeAndBoundVariables remains.

Giselle produecd a list of occurrences of AbsInScope and we divided the work and will discuss the problematic cases next meeting. The list is attached as division-plan-absinscope.txt .

* Next meeting:

We try to get a regular meeting in Menger after the project meeting, the next one is scheduled at March 20th, 15:00.
