Next meeting: 

= Lambda Calculus =

We decdied to remove deBruijn indices. Giselle volunteered for the coding work.


= Variable Capture in Substitution =

Having the lambda term \x.y and applying the substitution {y <- x} yields \x.x, but this is wrong.
We decided for an automatic renaming of the bound variable if a variable capture would occur and to
postpone this until the deBruijn indices are removed.

See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Capture-avoiding_substitutions .

Remark: the quantifier rules of LK do only check for syntactic equality in the assertion. This 
needs to be generalized to alpha equality.

= Bug in formalization of David's proof =

We agreed that Cvetan will comment out the part of his code which is causing an assertion to be invalidated 
and check it in. Then we can generate a backtrace and see what happened.
