= Issue 234/238 =

We investigated the problem in issue 234 [1]: skolemizing a first order proof creates 
higher order only quantifiers in between. We discussed the following variants:


 * adding an object skolemize_folproof which skolemizes first and calls hol2fol afterwards
 * adding factories for logical operators
 * doing an inline case distinction within skolemization (this is done in some other part of the sk method).

The first solution is computationally expensive, but probably the cleanest solution. The second one has the 
drawback that it duplicates the type constructors of FOL/HOL and the drawbacks of the third one are that it
is a local fix for a global problem and that it is also hard to extend.
