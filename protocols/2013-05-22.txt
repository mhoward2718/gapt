Protocol: Martin

= Minisat =

Daniel added minisat support to the system. 

* Martin will install minisat on the compileserver. 
* He will also put the requirement into the documentation.

= hol2fol =

Hol2fol still needs to be seperated into the actual conversion code and the introduction of 
 fresh function symbols for skolemterms.

* Daniel and Martin will do this.

= Skolemization =

We decided to change the first order skolemization to first call higher order skolemization and 
 then call hol2fol. This is less efficient but easier to maintain.

* Daniel will do the rewrite.

= Remove lkmodulo =

LK modulo is still in the system since acunification depends on datastructures in there. 

* Martin will move them and then delete LK modulo.
