= Symbol equality vs string equality =

There is a testcase where the variant v0 of of the variable v is compared to a user created variable v0. At the moment we expect the two to be equal, but it is debateable if this is should be generally the case, since the variant symbol and the string symbol contained are not the same class.

The drawback of the current implementation is that also containers like the Set and Map class consider the classes as equal which means, they cannot hold equal instances with different symbols at the same time.

On the other hand, it is very confusing for a user to see seemingly equal objects which formally differ, especially because we try to hide the symbols. Also it is not clear which symbol is required when looking for a variable in a formula.

Therefore we decided to keep string equality but to give the programmer/user the possibility to compare the symbol in cases the distinction is necessary.

= Generic types of substitution and bet-normalization =

Generic typing of betaNormalization is not correct, because betaNormalize[Var] might be inferred, which is not true in general.
We decided to remove the generic type and do explicit type casting in wrapper functions. 

= Work distribution =
