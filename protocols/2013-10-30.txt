= Topic 1 =
Sequent contains HOLFormulas, so calculi for FOL need to cast. A possible soltion is to make Sequent[T <: Formula] but this is not for now.

We'd like to have expressions and formulas as return values of substitution and betareduction. Overloading the methods works, but they are for some reason not selected by the compiler.

Some methods like var.freeVariables need casting for higher layers on their return value. One can put them into an object in each layer instead.

We decided to keep the symbols publicly accessible and in the constructor objects, since sometimes the user needs to pass their own symbols.
